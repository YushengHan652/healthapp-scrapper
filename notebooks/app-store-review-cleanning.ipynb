I use it all the time and I used to do it with my parents all the time, I’m never one to get inn-app-purchases and even with out them this app is a great workout, I do a few of these a day, and they really work up a sweat and have me gasping for air at the end. It’s not on-going nor too long breaks, you can pause it if you need a longer break or need to take a quick one in-between the exercise, but I thing 10 morning minutes is the perfect amount of time to get a sip of water and prepare for the next exercise. I think this workout is effective, and it’s super quick and fun with quite a bit of variety and quick breaks in between therefore, even without the subscriptions this is probably the best workout app to use (keep in mind, this is just my opinion) if you want to save time and money, work out, and throw in some variety then this is CERTAINLY the app for you!\\n                Cheers,\\n                      FoxyPup9']\n"
